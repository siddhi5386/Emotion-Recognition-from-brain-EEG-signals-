# Emotion-Recognition-from-brain-EEG-signals
Emotion recognition can be achieved by obtaining signals from the brain by EEG. This test records the activity of the brain in form of waves. We have used DEAP dataset on which we are classifying the emotion as valance, like, arousal, dominance. We have used **LSTM** and **CNN** classifier which gives `88.60%` and `87.72%` mean accuracies respectively (Better/Comparable to existing models) to predict the model successfully.

[DEAP dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html) can be found on the official website.
